## About Me
Always fascinated with the way things work, I decided to undertake an engineering degree to turn this passion into a practice. This led me to Queen's University, for their general engineering first year would allow me to explore my interests before deciding upon a specialization. I had narrowed my decision down to 3 options: electrical, mechanical, and computer engineering. I ended up choosing to pursue a degree in mechanical engineering, for I thought it was the most flexible option, allowing me to incorporate aspects of both electrical and computer engineering into the program. I kept this mentality throughout the duration of my degree, selecting electives in electrical and software engineering, doing design projects that strengthened expertise in these areas, and doing a thesis that combined all three disciplines; using machine learning and computer vision to detect faults in manufacturing processes. I graduated Queen's with honours, receiving several scholarships along the way, including an NSERC scholarship to work on independent research.
